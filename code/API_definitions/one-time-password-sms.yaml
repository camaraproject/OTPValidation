  title: One Time Password SMS
  description: |-
    Service Enabling Network Function API to send short-lived OTPs (one time passwords) to a phone number via SMS and validate it afterwards, in order to verify the phone number as a proof of possession.

    # Relevant  Definitions and concepts
    - **NaaS**: *Network-as-a-Service* model where Telco Network resources are exposed to third parties through APIs. In this particular API, One Time Password is exposed following this model. 
    - **OTP**: *One Time password* is a one-time authorization code (OTAC) that is valid for only one login session or transaction.

    # API Functionality 
    It enables a Service Provider (SP) to send an OTP code by SMS and validate it to verify the phone number (MSISDN) as a proof of possession.

    # Resources and Operations overview
    This API currently provides two endpoints, one to send an OTP to a given phone number and another to validate the code received as input.
