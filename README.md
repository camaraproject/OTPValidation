# OTPValidation

Incubating API Repository to evolve and maintain the definitions and documentation of OTPValidation Service API within the Sub Project [Number Insights](https://lf-camaraproject.atlassian.net/wiki/x/BYEpBQ)

* API Repository [wiki page](https://lf-camaraproject.atlassian.net/wiki/x/yDXe)

## Scope

* Service APIs for “OTPValidation” (see APIBacklog.md)  
  * The OTP SMS API facilitates real-time verification of a user's device by sending a unique code via SMS to the specified mobile phone number. The process involves three key steps:
1. **Code Generation and Delivery:**  
   The send-code operation is used by the API consumer (e.g., an application) to request a one-time code to be sent by SMS to the application user's mobile phone along with an message to the user's mobile device.
2. **User Input:**  
   The user receives the SMS and enters the received code into the application.
3. **Verification:**  
   The application submits the entered code using the validate-code operation, which then verifies its accuracy and responds with a confirmation indicating whether the code is valid.

This process ensures secure, real-time validation of user possession of the specified device, enhancing authentication security.
  *  by delivering a one-time password (OTP) to it through SMS and validating the received code with the user's operator after the code is entered as requested.
  * Started: October 2022
  * Incubating stage since: February 2025
