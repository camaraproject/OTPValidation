# OTP Validation

Repository to describe, develop, document and test the OTPValidation API family

## Scope

* Service APIs for “OTPValidation” (see APIBacklog.md)  
  * One Time Password SMS API performs real-time checks to verify that the user possessed the device that carries the indicated mobile phone number.
  * It provides a frequent method of verifying possession of the device by delivering an OTP (one-time password) through SMS and validating it afterwards.
  * NOTE: The scope of this API family should be limited (at least at a first stage) to 4G and 5G.
* Describe, develop, document and test the APIs (with 1-2 Telcos)
  * Started: October 2022
  * Incubating stage since: February 2025
